How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros: manually choosing when to create a commit can let you decide the moment to save the version, so if you save it at every logical change, the version won't get too big or too short. 

cons: systems crash sometime.
